Hanoi instructions:


   Hello and welcome to play some Towers of Hanoi!
   As a default value we have 6 disks but you are also able to change the amount of them from 2 to 8 disks.(from the settings-menu on the top)
   At the start all the disks are going to be on the same peg (the left one). Your job is to move them accross the three
   pegs in a way that they all en up in the middle or in the far right peg in the same order in which they were at the start.
   Please note that you are not able to move a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Illegal moves are prohibited and you will
   be noted if you try to make an illegal move!.

   You can move the disks by clicking the left click of your mouse twice: first you choose the peg from which you'd like to
   move a disk and then you choose the peg you want to transfer it to. You can either click the peg itself or the button below it.
   The game will end when you achieve to move the disks to another peg in the same order as at the start. If you'd like to play again
   you can start a new game without closing the app from the menu on the top of the user interface. Option to close the game can also be found there.


Extra features:
- You are able to start a new game when you want to but espescially when you manage to win the game. Yuou don't need to close the game in between games. (5p)

- There is two ways to move the disks: You can choose pegs with your keyboard. A = left peg, S = middle peg and D = right peg. You can move a disk by pressing the correct
   key to choose the starting peg and then the target peg. For example to move from left to middle press A, then S. (20p)
